# Info

This repository contains a data analysis project aimed at found the best model finding quality of red wine based on various chemical properties.

## Project Structure

- `wine-quality_Kaggle/`
    - `data/`: Contains the wine features dataset.
    - `wine_quality.ipynb/`: Saved data analysis project.
    - `README.md`: Project documentation.
 
## Project Workflow

1. **Data Exploration**
   - Load the Wine Quality dataset.
   - Analyze the dataset to understand the structure and relationships.
   - Visualize key features and their distributions.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Standardize the features to improve model performance.
   
3. **Models Training**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train several machine learning models:
      - Linear Regression
      - Decision Tree Classifier
      - Random Forest Regressor
      - Random Forest Classifier
      - Cat Boost Regressor
      - Cat Boost Classifier

## Results

The Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 44%.
